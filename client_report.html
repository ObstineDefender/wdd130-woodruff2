    <h2>Client Report</h2>  
    <h4> How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h4>
    <p>How I decide what content and images was to be used for my site plan was how relevant it seemed. Some of the images I chose because of it look historical and so I put it in the history section, while others fit the description for kids learning how to swim. content was given that which matched the purpose on the site and that gave instructions how to swim or a historical lesson.</p>
    <h4> How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h4>
    <p> I communicated with my dev with email. I mean the only issue that I ran into is I am not sure he knows how to give me the link. I haven't gotten it and I have sent follow up emails.</p>
    <h4> Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h4>
    <p>  I saw it once in person on his computer. I am not sure if it really met my expectations, but it looked like it was in the right track.</p> 
    <h4> What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h4>
    <p>I will find a more consistent method to contact and to recieve updates better.</p>
    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>  
        <h4>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h4>
            <p>I wasn't the best at it, but I communicated in class letting them know. I later went to teams and gave them more updates and the whole file of the site plan from the client.</p>
        <h4>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h4>
            <p>I communicated through email, and there were no issues. Not much contact, but he said everything looked good he just wanted the gallery worked on, which I think i was able to communicate to the jr developer to fix.</p>
        <h4>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h4>
            <p>I just gave my client the link and they were able to see live updates whenever they wanted.</p> 
        <h4>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h4>
            <p>It honestly wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I remember in my technical teamwork class I thought it was messy, however the github desktop made things a lot easier.</p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
        <h4>It honestly wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I remember in my technical teamwork class I thought it was messy, however the github desktop made things a lot easier.</h4>
            <p>So one of my team leads we used teams. The other, no contact, but I had contact with the other jr developer and we just worked together. Ethan showers was able to give us the site plan on the git hub though.</p>
        <h4>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h4>
            <p>Yeah! I knew what was expected of me and each site plan we had was clear.</p>
        <h4>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h4>
            <p>I was able to contribute to all the sites I was in charge of. Each of us had one page in each team. I would just make a subsection of the css code if I wanted something else.</p> 
        <h4>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h4>
            <p>Nope, I am glad we had been tought to pull from the original first before we pushed our changes.</p>

    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
        <h4>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h4>
            <p>The challenging part was consistent communication all around the board. I struggled with my own, but I had one team I was apart of where there was consistent communication and that was with William Purvines. As for the others, I would just talk in person when possible, with Johnathan it was quite easy since we are neighbors.</p>
        <h4>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h4>
            <p>I enjoyed having the opportunity to work with others with different perspectives and different ways to get things done.</p>
        <h4>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h4>
            <p>If I were to take this project again I would work more with other lines of communication, especially since I prefer discord or whatsapp. I would also spend more time meticously studying each line of code, I used AI to assist me since I had pressures of other assignments with pressing deadlines.</p> 
        <h4>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h4>
            <p>I feel a little more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience especially since working with others. It has helped me to realize each persons skills and to identify them to help them magnify their talents and to help spend less time on the project and get it done faster.</p>
